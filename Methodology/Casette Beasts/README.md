Game is using internal FPS lock. It must be patched.

# How to find offsets

We need to use disassembler in this case.

After finishing disassembling main, we need to find this string (it's encoded as UTF-16-LE):
```
debug/settings/fps/force_fps
```

then we go to its first xref.

We are looking first for first `free` call above referenced instruction, then for first instruction below `free` call. It should read from some pointer address.
In our case it's X22.
```asm
.text:0000007100CDB264                 BL              free
.text:0000007100CDB268                 LDR             X19, [X22]
.text:0000007100CDB26C                 STUR            XZR, [X29,#var_10]
.text:0000007100CDB270                 ADRP            X1, #aDebugSettingsF@PAGE ; "debug/settings/fps/force_fps"
.text:0000007100CDB274                 ADD             X1, X1, #aDebugSettingsF@PAGEOFF ; "debug/settings/fps/force_fps"
.text:0000007100CDB278                 SUB             X0, X29, #-var_10
.text:0000007100CDB27C                 BL              sub_7100018E40
.text:0000007100CDB280                 MOV             W8, #2
```

So we need to find what X22 stores. We are doing that by searching for `LDR X22` instruction before our xref.

In our case it looks like this:
```asm
.text:0000007100CD9F68                 ADRP            X22, #off_71033C8370@PAGE
.text:0000007100CD9F6C                 LDUR            X8, [X29,#var_98]
.text:0000007100CD9F70                 LDR             X22, [X22,#off_71033C8370@PAGEOFF]
```

At `off_71033C8370` is stored fixed pointer `qword_71033DCB78`. This is where our pointer to FPS settings are stored -> `MAIN+0x33DCB78`.

FPS Lock is stored at offset 0x30 as int32.

So our example entry will look like this
```yaml
15FPS:
  # debug/settings/fps/force_fps
  -
    type: write
    address: [MAIN, 0x33DCB78, 0x30]
    value_type: int32
    value: 15
  -
    type: block
    what: timing

```
