> Details

Game is using internal FPS Lock, so it's not possible to set more than 30 FPS with plugin alone. Beside that games has some 2D rendering tied to framerate + also QTE is tied to framerate, so setting 60 FPS causes QTE to be 2x faster.<br>
Because some things require patching executable, it's not possible to make FPS Locker patch. 
For 60 FPS mod look [HERE](https://gbatemp.net/threads/paper-mario-the-origami-king-60-fps-mod.570306/), though some bugs weren't fixed.
