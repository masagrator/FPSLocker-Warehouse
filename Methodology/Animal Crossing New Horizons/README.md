Game engine is designed only for 30 FPS. Game speed, physics, animations are all hardcoded to run at 30 FPS, so it requires tons of IPS patches to try fix it. 
It's not possible to make a LOCK patch that will fix this to run properly at 60 FPS. Don't expect proper compability with FPSLocker like never. My endeavor ended [HERE](https://gbatemp.net/threads/animal-crossing-new-horizon-60-fps.560209/post-9029449)
