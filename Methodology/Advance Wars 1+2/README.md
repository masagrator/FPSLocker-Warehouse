Game in battles is locked to 30 FPS and plugin alone cannot set there FPS above 30, so we need patch.

# How to find offsets

We need to use disassembler in this case. I will provide instructions based on Ghidra.

We need to import `main` to Ghidra, apply `script.json` generated with il2cppdumper, then search where is
```cs
UnityEngine.Rendering.OnDemandRendering_TypeInfo
```

To pointer stored there we add 0xB8, then we read from that pointer our address where `renderFrameInterval` is stored.

So by default it looks like this:
```yaml
30FPS:
  # _UnityEngine.Rendering.OnDemandRendering_TypeInfo
  -
    type: write
    address: [MAIN, 0x481B2F8, 0xB8, 0]
    value_type: int32
    value: 2
```

But because setting this with vsync interval to 2 causes input lag to be bigger, we will set for all FPS entries as 1.
So finally it should be:
```yaml
30FPS:
  # _UnityEngine.Rendering.OnDemandRendering_TypeInfo
  -
    type: write
    address: [MAIN, 0x481B2F8, 0xB8, 0]
    value_type: int32
    value: 1
```
