Plugin alone allows going above 30 FPS, but it's using double buffer, so setting anything else than 60, 30, 20 and 15 FPS results in unstable framerate.
Only I will explain how to get a dynamic resolution frame timing, which by default is 30.<br>
Thanks to Hazerou for figuring out where resolution setting is stored, this helped me a lot at determining where dynamic resolution frame timing is stored.

# How to find offsets

We need to disassemble main. I will be using IDA.

After analyzing `main` we need to find function:
```cpp
nn::oe::GetCurrentFocusState(void)
```

It will have only 2 xrefs, in my case it's first one.<br>
We are going to this xref and after BL that calls this function we need to find first BL instruction that calls `operator new(ulong)`.<br>
Then we are searching before that instruction for first pointer loading instruction.

In my case it looks like this:
```asm
.text:000000710032C25C                 LDR             X24, [X24,#off_7100C27AE8@PAGEOFF]
.text:000000710032C260                 LDR             X26, [X24]
.text:000000710032C264                 MOV             W0, #0x18 ; unsigned __int64
.text:000000710032C268                 BL              _Znwm_0 ; operator new(ulong)
```
At off_7100C27AE8 is stored hardcoded pointer qword_710155A880. Our float value is stored at offset 4, so our dynamic resolution value is stored at `[MAIN+0x155A880]+4`.

So for 15 FPS it will look like this:
```yaml
15FPS:
  # Dynamic Resolution frame time target = (30/(1000/30)) * (1000/FPS)
  -
    type: write
    address: [MAIN, 0x155A880, 4]
    value_type: float
    value: 60
```
