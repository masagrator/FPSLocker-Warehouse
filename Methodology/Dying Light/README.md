Plugin alone can set FPS above, but because of dynamic resolution frametime range set to 28-34ms, performance is subpar. We need to tweak this.<br>
But those values are hardcoded into executable, so we cannot patch it with FPSLocker.

For 60 FPS cheat that tweaks also dynamic resolution to match 60 FPS DR timings look [HERE](https://github.com/ChanseyIsTheBest/NX-60FPS-RES-GFX-Cheats/blob/main/titles/01008C8012920000/cheats/8C93B930348C9787.txt)
