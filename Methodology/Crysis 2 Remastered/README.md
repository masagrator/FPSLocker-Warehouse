Game using 2 internal FPS locks. One call sys_MaxFPS is the public one and allows setting FPS to max 45. Second one was hardcoded into "Renderer" thread.
It was possible to change them with FPSLocker patch, but it was not possible to tweak Dynamic Resolution with it.

For 45 and 60 FPS cheats with DR tweak look [HERE](https://github.com/ChanseyIsTheBest/NX-60FPS-RES-GFX-Cheats/blob/main/titles/0100582010AE0000/cheats/B3967105033ACC08.txt)
