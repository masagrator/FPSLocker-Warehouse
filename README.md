# FPSLocker Warehouse

Here you will find list with 30 FPS locked games, if they have FPSLocker patches that allow going above 30 FPS, tweak dynamic resolution frame timing for better performance, etc.

Remember that this plugin is limited by SaltyNX capabilities. 
Read SaltyNX readme to check which games are not compatible with plugin.

STATUS stores info if plugin is enough to go above 30 FPS or it requires additional patches.<br>
Patches status concern only FPSLocker "LOCK" patch format. There may exist cheat/IPS patch/mod that unlocks 60 FPS already.<br>
As it's filled by community, it may not be up to date.

🟢 - Plugin alone is enough<br>
🟡 - Plugin alone allows going above 30 FPS, but additional patches are required to tweak things like dynamic resolution frame timing<br>
🔴 - Plugin alone is not enough, patches are required
