  # Address that is used to determine if it should use dev's own classes to get vsync target
  # If we change it to anything that is above or equal 0, it's using Unity class that always returns -1
  # Returning from function getting vsync target anything else than 2 results in Dynamic Resolution target set to 60 FPS, otherwise it's 30 FPS
  # We cannot patch those FPS targets directly with FPSLocker as they are hardcoded
